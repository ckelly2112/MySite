        Check out the navigation bar at the top to see some of my projects. If you're more concerned about the work I put in go ahead and click on the <a href="/links">links</a> tab
        to check out my GitHub, or even my LinkedIn page!
            Most of the work on this website will include stuff created for school or personal projects and will 
            include a brief description about what the project in question was about.

            This site has also been updated to include <a class="font-weight-bold" href="https://getbootstrap.com/">bootstrap</a>, as well as a better interface. Let me know what you think!

            At the bottom of this page, as with most of my work, I will provide links to my various professional accounts (GitHub, LinkedIn etc.)
            <br>
